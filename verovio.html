         <p>The first XML element I chose to compare was that of the piece's first note. The most obvious point of comparison was in the percieved efficiency of MEI in contrast to MusicXML - the note constituted one line of code in the former, twelve in the latter. However, in those twelve lines of code, MusicXML does convey more raw information. 9 pieces of information are displayed hierarchically, while MEI contains only 5, presented linearly, & one of those is a unique identifier for the note. This is likely incredibly useful for closer analysis, where MusicXML's alternative of giving the exact X and Y co-ordinates is more useful in specific use cases - fascillitating an exact recreation of the layout of the score encoded in text form - but outwith those instances where that may be useful information to encode, it is certainly a lot of characters spent on what would then be facilitated by what MEI boils down into a single 8-character identifier. There are use cases where MusicXML's sheer volume of information could be useful, as some scores may require that level of specificity in its layout, and the impact on file sizes seems trivial in today's age of data storage (more than double 55 kilobytes is still only 121 kilobytes!)</p>
    <p>This trend of specific yet possibly wasteful data in MusicXML continues when we look at the encoding of the various instruments towards the very beginning. MusicXML contains information about the spcific MIDI channel & volume each instrument should utilise, information that may be wasted in some contexts.</p>
    <p>The encoding of the title occurs in different contexts across MEI and MusicXML, too - MEI opts to place the score's title within a very broad set of categories within a "fileDesc" tag. MusicXML has a similar structure - two "work" tags bracket the encoding of the title, followed by a section lablelled by tags reading "identification", but even with little information encoded in my MEI file's "fileDesc", I can see that it appears better-organised, with very readable sub-categories and sub-sub categories.</p>

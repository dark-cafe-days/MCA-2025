Week 1 Tasks
<br>
Task 2 - The theme for my dataset will be the work that videogame music composer Shinji Hosoe has done for the Zero Escape trilogy of horror-themed puzzle games. Due to the series' cult status, each of the three outlined data types should prove obtainable for his three soundtracks - MuseScore's community pages have a few of his contributions available as fan-transcribed sheet music, even if those lean more heavily towards the latter two entries. The soundtracks are available on Youtube, and the soundtrack for the final game in the series had an official triple-CD release a couple of years ago, containing the entire original soundtrack for the third game, and a significant selection of both original and re-arranged compositions from the first two.

While that covers both notated and acoustic data, metadata may prove slightly harder to come by. While plenty of it exists online and in English, some is limited to its original Japanese, and may prove hard to translate. However, I have access to .FLAC files from the official CD release that should at least provide a decent basis for metadata analysis.

Task 3 - There are plenty of issues it is possible to encounter when workng with music-related data, and although I believe my chosen theme should avoid encountering most of these - as well as the project's status as educational providing protection when navigating copyright issues - when the series that my chosen musicstems from has a small but dedicated fanbase in English. However, problems are likely to arise should I have to engage with anything that has not already been translated from the original Japanese by any multilingual fans. This may be an issue with gathering the aforementioned metadata - while music from the third game has an official soundtrack release in Japan with English titles for every song, music from the first two entries in the series has no such release or translation.

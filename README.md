Week 1 Tasks

Task 2 - A potential theme for my dataset will be the live bootleg recordings of the improvosational post-rock band SWANS - There is a well-documented fan archive of almost every single show the band has played since 1982, from various sources ranging from phone voice notes to soundboard mixes. Each has at least cursoury metadata (and some an overwhelming amount) and recordings of the shows. A few of their songs have fanmade sheet music from the MuseScore community, notably their earlier, simpler compositions from before the band's self-described "big sound" era.

Task 3 - Navigating copyright will likely be the largest difficulty I face throuhgout this project, given I will be working with bootleg recordings of copyrighted material. The curation element will possibly become a challenge, as there is such a vast amount of material - 228 GB of audio, although that some are presented in incredibly high-resolution FLAC files is likely inflating that number somewhat - for me to sort through.
However, all of the data is incredibly well-organised and described, with occasionally exhaustive detail about the capture methods & mixing processes each bootleg went through. Certainly, neither the "audio recordings" or "metadata" criteria will be hard to find within this archve.
The sheet music, given its entirely fanmade nature, is less well-organised and tabulated. One song only has its intro, another is entirely unfinished.

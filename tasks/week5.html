        <p>For my metadata schema, beyond the three prescribed elements of title, artist, and publisher, I chose to include a subtitle (specifying that the piece is 'from Zero Time Dilemma'), the distrubutor (noting the company that published the CD release that my piece originates from, as in this isntance it is different from the company that published the song, specifically,) and a genre classification using the < annot > tag.</p>

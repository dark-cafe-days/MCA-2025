        <p>The time-frequency analysis' benefits are especially obvious in the spectrogram for the first track, <i>Tick Down</i>. The song (accompanying the game's opening title screen) has the sound of a clock ticking throughout, with an additional melody joining in after 4 seconds. This is arguably visible in the waveform, but is made downright obvious in the spectrogram. There is a more accurate and intuitive sense of not only the timing of the ticks than the waveform gives, but also a better understanding of how the melody ebbs and flows throughout the song's short runtime. Similarly, in <i>Blue Bird Lamentation</i>, the opening few bars of the track are presented as an in-universe music box, before the non-diagetic orchestra swoops in for the bulk of the song. The spectrogram makes it very obvious that this is a case of additional instruments joining the frey for the middle of the song, rather than a simple increase in volume.</p>

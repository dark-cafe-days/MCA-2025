    <h1>Week 2</h1><br>
        <p>I chose to transcribe Hosoe's piece 'Nostalgic Scenery', from the third entry in the Zero Escape series manually using MuseScore. I transcribed a rendering of the song available <a href="https://musescore.com/user/33963700/scores/7645421" target="_blank">here</a> on MS's community page.</p>
    <p>Manually transcribing was not my first choice: after spending time getting Audiveris OMR set up, Musescore's website seemingly refused to let me download the fanmade score as a PDF without paying their subscription, despite the piece not being labelled as any form of premium download. Therefore, I set out to transcribe the piece manually.</p> 
    <p>There was initially a large amount of friction with, for example, getting Musescore to recognise the tempo of my piece (I eventually realised I was changing only the playback tempo, not the tempo of the score itself, when using the tempo options located in the upper right of my screen). After memorising some keyboard shortcuts and configuring some preferences to suit me better, I ended up finding the experience rather seamless after transcribing my third bar.</p>
    <p>It was, however, that third bar that caused the most problems. The original fanmade score places its [fourth] note as a dotted semiquaver, which when transcribing directly caused there to be an additional quarter-beat's worth of music within the bar, wreaking havoc on the rest of the score. Removing the dot on the semiquaver now caused there to be one quarter-beat too few. After consulting with the GTA, I eventually settled on using a non-dotted quaver, which is both unideal and confusing given the same dotted semiquaver caused no problem on Musescore's website, but every problem within its own software. A screenshot showing this discrepency sits below.</p><br>

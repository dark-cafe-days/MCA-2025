    <h1>Week 4</h1>
        <h2>Task 1: jSymbolic</h2>
            <p>My chosen jSymbolic analyses are:</p><br>
             <ul>
                <li>Number of Pitches - 20</li>
                <li>Number of Pitch Classes - 7</li>
                <li>Range - 50</li>
                <li>Strong Tonal Centres - 2</li>
                <li>Mean Pitch - 72.51</li>
                <li>Mean Pitch Class - 5.396</li>
                <li>Most Common Pitch - 76</li>
                <li>Most Common Pitch Class - 4</li>
                <li>Interval Between Most Prevelant Pitches - 3</li>
                <li>Pitch Variability - 11.26</li>
                <li>Last Pitch - 71</li>
                <li>Most Common Melodic Interval - 7</li>
                <li>Most Common Rhythmic Value - 5</li>
             </ul> 
             <p>These analyses show a few interesting details about my piece - despite it being a rather repetitive one, the 'range' is actually fairly high - so while the rhythm remains fairly consistent, the pitch is actually moving up and down quite a bit, as evidenced by the high 'pitch variability', as well.</p>

        <p>The graph thumbnails are outlined in black - you can click on them to see full-size versions in a new tab.</p>
        <h3>Note Quarter Length by Pitch (Piano Roll) - </h3>
            <a href="../data/wk4_1.JPG" target="new">
                <img src="../data/4_1thumbnail.png" alt="piano roll image">
            </a>
            <p>This graph demonstrates the range of pitches (vertical axis) present across the first 10 bars of my piece. This shows the repetitive structure of the song - not surprising as this is a piece of background music - with the same rythmic pattern repeated multiple times, yet with the pitch moving up & down across each repetition of the song's central motif, reaching its highest pitch (B6) in bar 8.</p>
        <h3>Scatter Plot</h3>
           <a href="../data/wk4_2.JPG" target="new">
               <img src="../data/4_2thumbnail.png" alt="scatter plot image">
           </a> 
            <p>This displays the same information in a more holistic manner - simply engaging with the note length in isolation rather than within a temporal context. It is also, unlike the piano roll, not limited to the first 10 bars of my piece.</p>
        <h3>Histogram</h3>
            <a href="../data/wk4_3.JPG" target="new">
               <img src="../data/4_3thumbnail.png" alt="histogram image">
           </a>
            <p>The histrogram confirms what can be intuited from the piano roll - that E5 is the most common note within <i>Nostalgic Scenery</i>'s opening. However, the notches marking out the x axis do not seem to scan particularly well, there being no markings other tha C3, 4, 5, etc. Marking out E or a similar half-step in the legend may make this graph easier to discern by eye.</p>
